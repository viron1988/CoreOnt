    <h1>Core Ontology in Robotics</h1>
    <p>Core Ontology is a powerful tool for representing knowledge in structured and organized way. In the field of robotics, Core Ontology can be used to model the relationships between robots, sensors, actuators, and other components of a robotic system.</p>
    <p>By using Core Ontology to represent robotic knowledge, we can make it easier to develop, maintain, and reuse software components for robotic systems.</p>
